Public vs private 
(access modifiers)

modify who is allowed to acces the files

everything in same folder is in a package

        same class                  different class

public      true                        true

private     true                        false

      


make everything as private as possible, unless it needs to be seen by others

static-belongs to class vs belongs to instance
