Planting my sunflower seeds now!
I have 30 seeds left.
No sprouts yet. Let's keep watering and waiting.
Yay! Sprouts!
I see something poking out of the soil!
The plant is green and the stalk is 0.5 inches tall.
The sunflower is so pretty!
There are 160 petals and they're bright and yellow.
The sunflower is 56.5 inches tall.
