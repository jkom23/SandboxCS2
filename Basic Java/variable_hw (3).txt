Use words to describe what the following lines of code do.


	boolean gameOver;
It will say whether the game Is over or not (true false)
	double gravity = 9.81;
It will store the value of "gravity" to be 9.81
	numTests = 0;
It sets the value of numTests to 0
	String errorMessage = “Something’s wrong!”;
It is a set of char in a string message

What type of variable would be best for the following situations?


	I need to store the number of jelly beans in a jar.
You should use an int, it is a whole number.
	My fingers are getting tired of typing “Mr. Lee” over and over again.
Use Char, you can store a string of characters.
	I want a quick way to see if the store is open or not.
Use a boolean, they are true/false.
	I want a counter that keeps track of how many visits my website got.
Use an int, they can store whole numbers. Unless your website gets over 4.2 billion visits, you will have ample space.
	I need to calculate the area of a circle given the radius.
Use a double, it can handle non whole numbers.
	I want to remember the name of a restaurant so I can check it out after work.
Use Char, you can store a string of characters.
