1. I want the greeps to detect paint colors around them, move to the paint and then give a tomato to the other greep. 1/2 the greeps shoudl send the inital paint signal, and the other half would move towards them.
 I want this to be in a loop where greep A loads a tomato onto the greep B, and then the greep B loads a tomato onto greep A.
2. 10 greeps will send a paint signal, which the other 10 greeps will detect and move towards them so they can work together
3.
    1. carryingTomato()
    2. dropTomato()
    3. spit(String color)
    4. seePaint(String color)
    5. turnHome()
